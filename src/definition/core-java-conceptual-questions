Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Computer programmes, as you may know, are essentially lists of instructions to be carried out by the six
logical units of a computer:
   The data from input devices such as the keyboard, mouse, and any other peripherals is received by the
   input unit. The primary memory unit (Random Access Memory(RAM)) stores computer programmes, data from
   input devices, and data to be delivered to output devices in a fast-access format. ALU performs arithmetic
   computations on data stored in memory, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison.
   The Central Processing Unit (CPU) controls the other units by delivering messages to the input unit,
   instructing it to read data into the memory unit, and informing the ALU which data to process. The Storage
   Unit saves and retrieves data and programmes for later use in long-term storage (e.g., a hard disc drive).The output
   unit delivers data from the computer to a printer, network device, or other device outside of the computer.

what is class?
A. A class ia a blueprint.

What is object?
A. A instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method.


Why main is static?
A. Main is static so it can be created directly from Java virtual machine.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A.Object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. The difference is that path is used to set the path for all Java software tools
and classpath is used to et the path for java class.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. The difference is that Abstract class can have abstract methods and non abstract methods
and Interface only have abstract methods.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A.No. However, you can implement a subclass of abstract class. You have to create a class which implement the
interface and implement bodies of interface methods for interface.

what is Access Specifier?
A. A  defining code element that can determine which elements of a program are allowed to access a
specific variable or other piece of data.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming is  creating objects that contain both data and methods.
 abstraction- The process of reducing the object to its essence so that only the necessary
 Characteristics are exposed to the users
 Encapsulation- All the setting of variable of a class is inside a method.
 Inheritance- Inherit the properties and methods of other classes.
 Polymorphism- One or more classes or objects related to each other by inheritance.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A java package is the the collection of Java classes and interfaces and


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application Programming Interface is a software middleman that allows two apps to
communicate with one another. like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java for two reasons: Every class in Java is a child of
the Object class. When a subclass inherits from multiple super classes, the property of the Object class
becomes ambiguous. Every class in Java has a function Object() { [native code] }, whether we define it
explicitly or not.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java for two reasons: Every class in Java is a child of the
Object class. When a subclass inherits from multiple super classes, the property of the Object class
becomes ambiguous. Every class in Java has a function Object() { [native code] }, whether we define it
explicitly or not.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exception Handling in Java is a robust tool for dealing with runtime failures while maintaining
the application's usual flow. We'll learn about Java exceptions, their kinds, and the distinction
between checked and unchecked exceptions in this tutorial.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. In Java, the static keyword is mostly used to control memory. In Java, the static keyword
is used to share a class's identical variable or method. Static keywords can be used with
variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes. The static keyword refers to a class rather than
a specific instance of that class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. The final keyword in Java is a non-access specifier for restricting access to a class, variable,
or function. If we use the final keyword to initialise a variable, we can't change its value.
When a method is declared final, it cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.The main distinction between final, finally, and finalise is that final is an access modifier,
finally is an Exception Handling block, and finalise is an object class method.... finalise is a Java
 method that is used to do cleanup processing shortly before an object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A. Is special method that is called when an object is instantiated. In other words, when you use the new
keyword.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. A class can only have one constructor.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. The default constructor

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. A keyword that is used as a reference to the object of the current class, with in an
instance method or a constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. is a reference variable that refers to an immediate parent class object.  When you create a subclass
instance, you're also creating an instance of the parent class, which is referenced to by the super reference variable.
Use of the Java supercomputer To refer to an immediate parent class instance variable, use the keyword super.
What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A. No.

What version of java are you using?
A. jdk1.8.0_301

What is JAR stand for ?
A. Java Archive.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit for creating Java applications.
It's a software bundle that includes the Java class libraries and other components needed to run
Java programming. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java byte code and provides an environment in
which it can be executed.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.JRE is an environment, in order to execute any Java program locally. JVM is where it's responsible
for converting the Bytecode into machine specific code and makes java program write-once-run-anywhere.

What is compile time and run time?
A.Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code.
Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
A. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

How java manage it's memory?
A. memory management automatically.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer is
thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not. That's why StringBuilder is faster than
StringBuffer. String concatenation operator internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.

What is Singleton class?
A. A class that can have only one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization in Java allows us to convert an Object to stream that we can send over
the network or save it as file or store in DB for later usage. Deserialization is the process
of converting Object stream to actual Java Object to be used in our program.

when to use transient variable in java?
A. At the time of serialization, if we don't want to save value of a particular variable
in a file, then we use transient keyword.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. While loop checks the condition first and then executes the statement, whereas do while
loop will execute the statement at least once, then the condition is checked. While loop statement
is executed zero times if the condition is false whereas do while statement is executed at least once.

What is Enum?
A. A special Java type used to define collections of constants.

What is Iterator?
A. An object that has methods that allow you to process a collection of items one at a time.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. Integer.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. Is immutable since String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. The process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. The parallel collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
A. Just In time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.  When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. The Heap Space contains all objects are created, but Stack contains any reference to
those objects. Objects stored in the Heap can be accessed throughout the application.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine
or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
A.Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for
maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. The capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
What is Framework?
A. Are bodies of pre-written code used by developers to create apps using the Java programming language.
What are the testing Framework available in java?
A.JUnit, TestNG.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. JUnit is an open-source framework used to trigger and write tests. TestNG is a Java-based framework that
is an upgraded option for running tests. JUnit does not support to run parallel tests. TestNG can run parallel
tests.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A. Resource dependencies.

what is dependency injection in java?
A. A technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. The static binding uses Type information for binding while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve to bind.
