Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data Structures are necessary for designing efficient algorithms. It provides reusability
and abstraction . Using appropriate data structure, can help programmers save a good amount of
time while performing operations such as storage, retrieval or processing of data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.Creation, Insertion, Traversal, Search, Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Data structures are used in any program or software, They are used in the areas of, Compiler Design, Operating
System, DBMS, Graphics, Simulation, Numerical Analysis.

what is an Array?
A. A data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements
are all of the same data type, such as an integer or string.


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array is an array is a fixed-length data structure and static in size meanwhile
ArrayList is is a class of Java Collections framework. It contains popular classes like
Vector, HashTable, and HashMap. ArrayList is dynamic in size.


what is LinkedList?
A. a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is
a sequence of links which contains items. ... Link − Each link of a linked list can store a
data called an element. Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of objects
known as a node where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address. Array elements store in
a contiguous memory location. Linked list elements can be stored anywhere in the memory or randomly stored.

what is queue?
A. A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the
“rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.”

what is stack?
A. A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered, linear sequence of items. In contrast to a
queue, a stack is a last in, first out structure.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method assumes that the last unit to arrive in inventory or more recent is
sold first. The First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method assumes that the oldest unit of inventory is the sold first.

what is the order of complexity?
A.What is order of complexity? Edit. Generally, an algorithm has an asymptotic computational complexity.
Assuming the input is of size N, we can say that the algorithm will finish at O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N)).

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. The best case of the array is O(1).

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case is O(n).

what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are
connected by edges. A tree has the following properties: The tree has one node called root. The tree originates from
this, and hence it does not have any parent.

what is graph in data structure?
A. A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices
are called edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. The difference is that HashTable is synchronized and HashMap is not.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
  RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)Network data model = Graph.
  RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)Network data model = Graph.Hierarchical data model = Trees.
How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap uses multiple buckets and each bucket points to a Singly Linked List where the entries (nodes) are stored.
Once the bucket is identified by the hash function using hashcode, then hashCode is used to check if there is already a
key with the same hashCode or not in the bucket(singly linked list).

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index.
This exception is thrown when the index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Manually, Arrays.copyOf(), System.arraycopy(), Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type.
Array elements store in a contiguous memory location and linked list is a collection of objects known as a node
where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure and
BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node and traverse
the graph layer wise thus exploring the neighbour nodes.

What is Recursion?
A. A process in which the function calls itself indirectly or directly in order to solve the problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear is a type of Data Structure where the data elements get linearly or sequentially arranged.
The elements attach themselves to their next and previous adjacent. The structure involves only a single
level- allowing a user to traverse all its components in a single run.
Non-linear is  a form of data structure where the data elements don’t stay arranged linearly or sequentially.
Since the data structure is non-linear, it does not involve a single level. Therefore, a user can’t traverse
all of its elements in a single run.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the
argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. ... In computer science, big O notation is used to
classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
